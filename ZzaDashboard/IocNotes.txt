IOC (Inversion of Control)/Dependency Injection 

Unity Framework (use version 3.1... instead of newest for time being, .Resolve<type>() method not found in newest one, need workaround)

1) Install unity nuget
2) create a unity container 'helper' to hold singleton instance of the container
3) register any types in it's static constructor that it is responsible for creating when needed.
4) on init of those variables, call the container.resolve<type>() method to allow for it to inject an instance

This instance will be reused for any injection if the 'ContainerControlledLifetimeManager' property is passed when registering the type.
